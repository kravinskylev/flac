## Flac
Flac is my first attempt at using the VoltRB framework, an alternative to Rails that allows you to use Ruby for the entire stack. In some ways, it's comparable to Meteor.js for Javascript. It also has built in web-sockets support, so I figured it could be fun to mess around and try to make a real time messaging app.
